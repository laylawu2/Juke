# Juke

Juke is a online music streaming service modeled after Spotify. Users can import their own music tracks or listen to the ones from our database. They will be able to play, pause, toggle the tracks and search for their favorite artists and albums.

## Technology

Juke is created as a single-page application. It was built with React.js, along with Redux.js, React-Router, Bootstrap and CSS3. For the back end, we designed and created our database using PostgreSQL and Sequelize.js. Node.js provided an optimal environment for real-time music streaming and support for non-blocking data transferring between the database and the React components via the Redux store. a
